# word-counter-app

### Creating this app (small project) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### In this challenge, my goal is to created 9-10 small projects, 11-12 medium size projects and 5-6 large size projects.
### The Tech stack which I am using are HTML, CSS and JS for small and medium size of projects and MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) for large size projects. And ofcourse I'll be using some handful libraries like Axios, Leaflot, MaterialUI etc.
